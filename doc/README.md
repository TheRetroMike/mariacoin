MARIA Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
[MARIA Core](http://maria.org/wallet) is the original MARIA client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of MARIA transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run MARIA Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/maria-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/mariad` (headless)

If this is the first time running MARIA Core (since v5.0.0), you'll need to install the sapling params by running the included `install-params.sh` script, which copies the two params files to `$HOME/.maria-params`

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run maria-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag MARIA-Qt to your applications folder, and then run MARIA-Qt.
